### properties.txt
### This is the property file used by the PMSCumulativeOW code
# It's divided into three section:
#	SECTION 1:  year-agnostic - properties that don't change from year to year
#	SECTION 2:	year-specific - properties that might change between years
#	SECTION 3:	year-agnostic - properties that don't change from year to year, but depend on year-specific properties

# Merged Member data file name pattern - the regexp pattern to recognize the merged member file to be used by this program.  
# Relative to SourceData/PMSSwimmerData
# If this needs to be overridden for some reason it should be done in the year-specific property file.

# PMS Club info file name pattern - the regexp pattern to recognize the club info file to be used by this program.

# NOTE:  we use the term "yearGroup" to represent a string used to identify part of the name of
# every file we generate.  The yearGroup is the concatenation of 'yyyy' and 'group' where:
#	yyyy - is USUALLY the year whose results are being processed, e.g. 2016
#	group - is USUALLY the group who generated those results, e.g. PacMasters
#			Other possible groups have been:
#				USA
#				USMS
#			when we've done similar processing for those organizations.
# This value is used when constructing the names of generated fiels, and is also slightly modified and used
# as titles in generated files.  Thus, if the yearGroup is some other text it's OK - as long as the file
# names and titles make sense.
# By default the programs reading this file will use the value of the 'YearBeingProcessed' property
# (defined in the year-specific property file read below) as the yyyy, and the following 'GroupDoingTheProcessing'
# property as the group and construct the yearGroup from them.
GroupDoingTheProcessing 	PacMasters

# "template" files are used to describe the files generated by the GenerateOWResults.pl application.
# Currently only HTML files are described by template files (the format of other generated files, e.g. .csv
# or .xlsx files are hard-coded in the application.)  The template files are located in a 
# directory named "Templates" located in the same directory as the application.

# Here we list the subdirectories under the Templates directory that we will use for templates
#  (none)

# This is likely overridden in the year-specific property file when the results for the year are finally approved
ResultsApproval <b>These results are unofficial until approved by the Open Water Committee Chair.</b>

# The OpenWaterScoringChairperson is used to hold a link to
# a page that a user can use to ask questions about the generated accumulated points page (or other
# pages that we generate.)

# We don't really use ExtraHeadNotes anymore, but it's a good idea so we'll leave it empty.
# These notes appear on the results near the top of the page and are accented so  they
